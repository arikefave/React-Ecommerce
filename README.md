# CORRECTIONS TO BE MADE

1. Ensure that the product grid in the homepage uses the "Masonry" system.
2. Also the background in the design is not implemented therein
3. The designs on the product page is not consistent enough yet. It should be picture perfect with the Figma design, ensure not to download/export the images with backgrounds from Figma
4. Also when we move to product page, the active (the nav-item whoose page we're currently on) changes to green with a green underline.
5. Elements page currently have the home page UI, what's going on with that?
6. Pages, Shop and Sale currently doesn't lead anywhere

## WHAT I LIKE

1. I noticed you've added the responsive design. That's good but can be better.
